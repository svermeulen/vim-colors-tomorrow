		Tomorrow Vim Colorscheme by Ethan Schoonover ~

Tomorrow Colorscheme					   *tomorrow*
							   *tomorrow-help*
							   *tomorrow-colors*
							   *tomorrow-colorscheme*
							   *vim-colors-tomorrow*

Tomorrow theme structure is based on the Solarized theme.

Solarized is a carefully designed selective contrast colorscheme with dual
light and dark modes that runs in both GUI, 256 and 16 color modes.

See the homepage at http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized for screenshots and 
details.

4. Terminal Issues			|tomorrow-term|

==============================================================================
0. Install						*tomorrow-install*

Note: I recommend using Tim Pope's pathogen plugin to install this 
colorscheme. See https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen . If you've installed 
pathogen properly you can install Tomorrow with the following commands, 
followed by the .vimrc configuration below.

	$ cd ~/.vim/bundle
	$ git clone https://github.com/slava/vim-colors-tomorrow.git

If you aren't using pathogen, you can use the following three steps to install 
Tomorrow:

1.  Download the tomorrow distribution (available on the homepage above)
    and unarchive the file.

2.  Move `tomorrow.vim` to your `.vim/colors` directory.

3.  Move each of the files in each subdirectories to the corresponding .vim
    subdirectory (e.g. autoload/togglebg.vim goes into your .vim/autoload
    directory as .vim/autoload/togglebg.vim).


After installation, place the following lines in your .vimrc:

	syntax enable
	set background=dark
	colorscheme tomorrow

or, for the light background mode of Tomorrow:

	syntax enable
	set background=light
	colorscheme tomorrow

==============================================================================
1. Tomorrow Menu					*tomorrow-menu*

Tomorrow makes available a menu when used in Vim GUI mode (gvim, macvim).  
This menu includes many of the options detailed below so that you can test out 
different values quickly without modifying your .vimrc file. If you wish to 
turn off this menu permanently, simply place the following line in your .vimrc 
above the "colorscheme tomorrow" line.

	let g:tomorrow_menu=0

==============================================================================
2. Toggle Background					*tomorrow-togglebg*
							*toggle-bg* *togglebg*
							*toggle-background*

Tomorrow comes with Toggle Background, a simple plugin to switch between 
light and dark background modes and reset the colorscheme. This is most useful 
for colorschemes that support both light and dark modes and in terminals or 
gui vim windows where the background will be properly set.

Toggle Background can be accessed by:

    * the Tomorrow menu (in Vim gui mode)
    * the Window menu (in Vim gui mode, even if the Tomorrow menu is off)
    * the "yin/yang" toolbar button (in Vim gui mode)
    * the default mapping of <F5>
    * custom key mapping you set in your .vimrc (see below)
    * command line via ":ToggleBG" (no quotes)

Toggle Background starts with a default mapping to function key <F5>. If you 
are already using this in a mapping, Toggle Background will not map itself to 
a default and you will have to map it manually in your .vimrc file, or 
remove/change your existing <F5> mapping to another value. To customize the 
keyboard mapping in your .vimrc file, use the following line, changing the 
"<F5>" value to the key or key combination you wish to use:

	call togglebg#map("<F5>")

Note that you'll want to use a single function key or equivalent if you want 
the plugin to work in all modes (normal, insert, visual).

When using the plugin during normal, visual, or insert mode, there should be 
no interruption in workflow. However, if you activate the plugin during 
REPLACE mode, you will switch to standard insert mode (you will leave the 
overwrite replace mode).

==============================================================================
3. Tomorrow Terminal Issues				*tomorrow-term*

If you are going to use Tomorrow in Terminal mode (i.e. not in a GUI version 
like gvim or macvim), **please please please** consider setting your terminal 
emulator's colorscheme to used the Tomorrow palette. I've included palettes 
for some popular terminal emulator as well as Xdefaults in the official 
Tomorrow download available from the Tomorrow homepage listed at the top of 
this help document. If you use Tomorrow *without* these colors, Tomorrow 
will need to be told to degrade its colorscheme to a set compatible with the 
limited 256 terminal palette (whereas by using the terminal's 16 ansi color 
values, you can set the correct, specific values for the Tomorrow palette).

If you do use the custom terminal colors, tomorrow.vim should work out of 
the box for you. If you are using a terminal emulator that supports 256 
colors and don't want to use the custom Tomorrow terminal colors, you will 
need to use the degraded 256 colorscheme. To do so, simply add the following 
line *before* the `colorschem tomorrow` line:

    let g:tomorrow_termcolors=256

Again, I recommend just changing your terminal colors to Tomorrow values 
either manually or via one of the many terminal schemes available for import.

4. Tomorrow Options					*tomorrow-options*


AUTOGENERATE OPTIONS

You can easily modify and experiment with Tomorrow display options using the 
Tomorrow menu when using Vim in gui mode. Once you have things set to your 
liking, you can autogenerate the current option list in a format ready for 
insertion into your .vimrc file using the Tomorrow menu "Autogenerate 
Options" command or at the command line with:

    :TomorrowOptions


OPTION LIST

Set these in your vimrc file prior to calling the colorscheme.

option name               default     optional
------------------------------------------------
g:tomorrow_termcolors=   16      |   256
g:tomorrow_termtrans =   0       |   1
g:tomorrow_degrade   =   0       |   1
g:tomorrow_bold      =   1       |   0
g:tomorrow_underline =   1       |   0
g:tomorrow_italic    =   1       |   0
g:tomorrow_contrast  =   "normal"|   "high" or "low"
g:tomorrow_visibility=   "normal"|   "high" or "low"
g:tomorrow_hitrail   =   0       |   1
g:tomorrow_menu      =   1       |   0
------------------------------------------------


OPTION DETAILS

------------------------------------------------
g:tomorrow_termcolors=   256     |   16		*'tomorrow_termcolors'*
------------------------------------------------
The most important option if you are using vim in terminal (non gui) mode!
This tells Tomorrow to use the 256 degraded color mode if running in a 256
color capable terminal.  Otherwise, if set to `16` it will use the terminal
emulators colorscheme (best option as long as you've set the emulators colors
to the Tomorrow palette).

If you are going to use Tomorrow in Terminal mode (i.e. not in a GUI
version like gvim or macvim), **please please please** consider setting your
terminal emulator's colorscheme to used the Tomorrow palette. I've included
palettes for some popular terminal emulator as well as Xdefaults in the
official Tomorrow download available from:
http://ethanschoonover.com/tomorrow . If you use Tomorrow without these
colors, Tomorrow will by default use an approximate set of 256 colors.  It
isn't bad looking and has been extensively tweaked, but it's still not quite
the real thing.

------------------------------------------------
g:tomorrow_termtrans =   0       |   1			*'tomorrow_termtrans'*
------------------------------------------------
If you use a terminal emulator with a transparent background and Tomorrow
isn't displaying the background color transparently, set this to 1 and
Tomorrow will use the default (transparent) background of the terminal
emulator. *urxvt* required this in my testing; iTerm2 did not.

Note that on Mac OS X Terminal.app, tomorrow_termtrans is set to 1 by 
default as this is almost always the best option. The only exception to this 
is if the working terminfo file supports 256 colors (xterm-256color).

------------------------------------------------
g:tomorrow_degrade   =   0       |   1			*'tomorrow_degrade'*
------------------------------------------------
For test purposes only; forces Tomorrow to use the 256 degraded color mode
to test the approximate color values for accuracy.

------------------------------------------------
g:tomorrow_bold      =   1       |   0			*'tomorrow_bold'*
------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------
g:tomorrow_underline =   1       |   0			*'tomorrow_underline'*
------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------
g:tomorrow_italic    =   1       |   0			*'tomorrow_italic'*
------------------------------------------------
If you wish to stop Tomorrow from displaying bold, underlined or
italicized typefaces, simply assign a zero value to the appropriate
variable, for example: `let g:tomorrow_italic=0`

------------------------------------------------
g:tomorrow_contrast  =   "normal"|   "high" or "low"	*'tomorrow_contrast'*
------------------------------------------------
Stick with normal! It's been carefully tested. Setting this option to high
or low does use the same Tomorrow palette but simply shifts some values up
or down in order to expand or compress the tonal range displayed.

------------------------------------------------
g:tomorrow_visibility =  "normal"|   "high" or "low" *'tomorrow_visibility'*
------------------------------------------------
Special characters such as trailing whitespace, tabs, newlines, when 
displayed using ":set list" can be set to one of three levels depending on 
your needs.

------------------------------------------------
g:tomorrow_hitrail   =   0       |   1			*'tomorrow_hitrail'*
------------------------------------------------
Visibility can make listchar entities more visible, but if one has set 
cursorline on, these same listchar values standout somewhat less due to the 
background color of the cursorline. g:tomorrow_hitrail enables highlighting 
of trailing spaces (only one of the listchar types, but a particularly 
important one) while in the cursoline in a different manner in order to make 
them more visible. This may not work consistently as Tomorrow is using 
a pattern match than can be overridden by a more encompassing syntax-native 
match such as a comment line.


------------------------------------------------
g:tomorrow_menu       =  1       |   0			*'tomorrow_menu'*
------------------------------------------------
Tomorrow includes a menu providing access to several of the above
display related options, including contrast and visibility. This allows
for an easy method of testing different values quickly before settling
on a final assignment for your .vimrc. If you wish to turn off this menu,
assign g:tomorrow_menu a value of 0.
